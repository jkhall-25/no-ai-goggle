This goggle is probably more accurately known as "less AI" since there are always AI images uploaded to other sites, and more AI image generation sites popping up all the time. However, this reduces the amount of AI image generation that appears in image search. 

This goggle is inspired by an [article](https://www.virtualcuriosities.com/articles/1632/how-to-remove-ai-images-from-google-results) in virtualcuriosities.com by Noel Santos.
